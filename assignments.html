<h2> Exams (30%) </h2>

There will be two midterm exams, accounting for 30% of your final grade.

<ul>
  <li> First midterm (in class on 3/3)
  <li> Second midterm (in class on 4/28)
</ul>

There will not be a final exam in this class. To help you prepare for these exams, I have posted copies of the exams from a previous year:

<ul>
  <li> <a href="midterm1_f08.doc">First midterm (Fall 2008)</a>
  <li> <a href="midterm2_f08.doc">Second midterm (Fall 2008)</a>
</ul>

<h2>Programming Assignments (60%)</h2>
<p>

There will be three programming assignments, accounting for 60% of your final grade.

<ul>
<li><a href="Assignment1">Assignment 1: Image Processing</a> (due 2/5 at 11:55PM)
<li><a href="Assignment2">Assignment 2: Ray Tracer</a> (due 3/19 at 11:55PM)
<li><a href="Assignment3">Assignment 3: OpenGL</a> (due 4/16 at 11:55PM)
</ul>

<h2>Class Participation (10%)</h2>
<p>

Your level of participation in class will account for the remaining 10% of your final grade.

<p>
<a name="late">
<h3>Late Policy</h3>
<p>

All of the programming assignments are due at 11:55PM on the due date. You have 5 (discrete!) late days that you can use any time during the semester.  After that, each late day reduces your grade by 1/2 (e.g., five late days results in 0.5^5*[original score]).

<p>
<a name="collaboration">
<h3>Collaboration Policy</h3>
<p>

You may discuss assignments with others, but everything handed in must
be your own work.  All code must be your own - you may not use code
from your classmates, the Internet, or any other source without prior
approval from the instructor.  Sharing your code with anyone else or
working with someone to write code are also violations of this policy.
In situations where you have received pre-approval from the instructor
to include external sources in your solution, you must still clearly
document these sources in your final write-up.

<p>
<a name="submitting">
<h3>Submitting Your Work</h3>
<p>

<ul>

<li>Submit your solutions to the programming assignments electronically through the <a href="http://collab.itc.virginia.edu">UVa Collab system</a>.  

<li> Create a single <tt>.zip</tt> or <tt>.tar.gz</tt> file
containing your code, results, and a write-up called <b>[your computing id].html</b>.  Your write-up should include the following:
<ul>
<li> Name
<li> UVa Computing ID
<li> Compiler / Environment / Platform used
<li> Number of late days used
<li> Description of the parts of the assignment that have been fully implemented, partially implemented, or left un-implemented</ul> 

<li> Any images, videos, etc. that are linked to by the write-up should be contained in a directory called <b>[your computing id]_HTML</b>.

<li> Submissions to the art contest should be contained in the <b>[your computing id]_HTML</b> directory and should be named <b>[your computing id].art.[submission #].[jpeg/bmp/avi/etc.]</b>.

<li> The code should compile. Code that does not compile will not be graded.

<li> The assignments are presented so that implementing the necessary code can be done completely within the *.todo.cpp files. Please restrict your coding to these sections. If you must modify other code, please specify accordingly in your write-up file.

<li> The archive should contain all .cpp, .h, .inl, and project / makefiles that are necessary for compilation.

<li> Please do not include any .exe, .obj, .o, .a, .lib, .ncb, .ilk, or any other binary or intermediate compiler files in the submission. 
</ul>
