<h3>Morphing Help for Assignment 1: Image Processing</h3></center>
<p align="left">This page is designed to give you a sense of what your images 
should look like and to help you test your results as you go along. First, 
recall that the command line is</p>
<blockquote><code>% assignment1 --in source.bmp --bnMorph dest.bmp line_segment_pair_file 0.5 --out out.bmp</code> </blockquote>
<p align="left">where <code>source.bmp</code> is the starting point for your morph, <code>dest.bmp</code> is 
the ending point for your morph, 0.5 specifies how far along in the morph you are (in this case, half way) and
<code>out.bmp</code> specifies the file into which the morph will be written. You also need to
input a file that contains your control lines. What is the format of this file? It look like this</p>
<p align="left">3&nbsp; <br>136&nbsp;&nbsp; 5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
186&nbsp;&nbsp; 
28&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 115&nbsp; 
43&nbsp;&nbsp; 182&nbsp;&nbsp; 74&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>186&nbsp;&nbsp; 32&nbsp;&nbsp; 
201&nbsp;&nbsp; 
52&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
184&nbsp;&nbsp;79&nbsp;&nbsp; 198&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;88&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<br>205&nbsp;&nbsp; 55&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;229&nbsp;&nbsp; 
73&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 202&nbsp; 
91&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 231 118&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">The first&nbsp;number, "3", tells us the total number of lines 
contained in the file. Then, we just start listing source and dest line pairs in 
the following way...&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<br>&lt;source_line1_start_x&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;source_line1_start_y&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;source_line1_end_x&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;source_line1_end_y&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;dest_line1_start_x&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;dest_line1_start_y&gt;...
</p>
<p align="left">and so on. So all the numbers in the left hand side correspond to 
control line points in the source image, while all the numbers on the right 
correspond to control line points in the destination image. We have given you 
some very simple control line files to get started. Note that the image origin 
is assumed to be in the upper left-hand corner of the image. </p>
<p align="left">So, <a href="BNTestFiles">here are some test files</a> and results to get you started. The control lines have 
been added to the images in this web page to help you understand what is going 
on, but in the files available to you, they exist only in the line files. Note 
that all these results were created using the default a, b, and p parameters 
given on the assignment page and the (default) nearest neighbor sampling. Your 
results should look much nicer if you use bilinear or gaussian sampling.</p>

<h3 align="left">Test Case 1: Simple Translation</h3>
<p align="left">Running this command line:<br>
</p><blockquote>
<code>% assignment1 --in F.bmp -bnMorph F_translated.bmp f_single_line_translate.txt 0.5 --out out.bmp</code>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>
<img src="BNMorph_files/F.jpg" border="1" height="300">
<img src="BNMorph_files/F_translated.jpg" border="1" height="300"> 
<img src="BNMorph_files/morph_translated.jpg" border="1" height="300"> 
</p><p>
with the first two images as source and dest respectively will give you the 
third image as the result. (That shadow around the F&nbsp; here and below tells 
you that our control lines didn't match up perfectly.)</p>

<h3 align="left">Test Case 2: Translation Plus Scale</h3>
<p align="left">Running this command line:<br>
</p><blockquote>
<code>% assignment1 --in F.bmp --bnMorph F_translated_scaled.bmp f_single_line_translate_scale.txt 0.5 --out out.bmp</code>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>
<img src="BNMorph_files/F.jpg" border="1" height="300">
<img src="BNMorph_files/F_translated_scaled.jpg" border="1" height="300">
<img src="BNMorph_files/morph_translated_scaled.jpg" border="1" height="300"> 
</p><p>
with the first two images as source and dest respectively will give you the 
third image as the result.</p>

<h3 align="left">Test Case 3: Translation Plus Rotation</h3>
<p align="left">Running this command line:<br>
</p><blockquote>
<code>% assignment1 --in F.bmp --bnMorph F_rotated.bmp f_single_line_translate_rotate.txt 0.5 --out out.bmp</code>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>
<img src="BNMorph_files/F.jpg" border="1" height="300">
<img src="BNMorph_files/F_rotated.jpg" border="1" height="300">
<img src="BNMorph_files/morph_rotated.jpg" border="1" height="300"> 
</p><p>
with the first two images as source and dest respectively will give you the 
third image as the result.</p>

<h3 align="left">Test Case 4: MultiLine</h3>
<p align="left">Running this command line:<br>
</p><blockquote>
<code>% assignment1 --in F.bmp --bnMorph F_scaled_2d.bmp f_multi_line_scale.txt 0.5 --out out.bmp</code> 
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>
<img src="BNMorph_files/F_four_lines.jpg" border="1" height="300">
<img src="BNMorph_files/F_scaled_2d.jpg" border="1" height="300">
<img src="BNMorph_files/morph_four_lines.jpg" border="1" height="300"> 
</p><p>
with the first two images as source and dest respectively will give you the 
third image as the result. Note that the morph is not angle preserving unless 
you are lined up with control lines. (This is what is causing the funny behavior 
at the bottom of the F and on the short edges.) </p>
<h3 align="left">One last thing...</h3>
<p align="left">After you have done all the above work, you may notice that it 
doesn't look so nice when you are sampling outside of the image. (This is what 
is causing the black border to get dragged in.) Depending upon the effect you 
want to create, you can "clamp" the sampling in such a way that instead of 
taking a black pixel "outside" of the image, you just choose the closest pixel 
on the image boundary. This corresponds to thinking of your image as a rubber 
sheet that is firmly attached at the boundaries. If you choose to do this, 
handle it in the morph function; don't change your sampling function. And be 
sure to document this in your write-up.</p></body></html>
