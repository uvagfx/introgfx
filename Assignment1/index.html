<h2>Programming Assignment 1: Image Processing</h2>

<b>Due Thursday, 2/5 at 11:55PM</b>

<!--
<H3>Announcements</H3>
<UL>
<LI>There seems to be a certain amount of confusion with regards to how the <CODE>Image::AddRandomNoise</CODE>
method should be implemented. The parameter input to this method represents the fraction of noise that should
be added to each color channel of each pixel and should be a value in the range [0.0,1.0]. So for example, if
the value is 0.0, then no noise should be added to the pixels. If the value is 0.5 then each color channel of each
pixel should have a random value in the range [-128,128] added to it. (This means that the amount of random noise
you add to a pixel should be independent of the pixel color.) Don't forget to clamp the color value so that the final
value is in the range [0,255].
<LI> When implementing the image rotation, remember that the cosine and sine functions take in
parameters that represent an angle in radians, not degrees.
<LI>For those of you who are compiling with Microsoft Visual C++, if you are running a version
that is more recent than 6.0, you may run into an error of the form: <CODE>cannot open 
file 'odcb32.lib'</CODE>. You can resolve this problem by right clicking on the project
in the Solution Explorer, selecting <CODE>properties</CODE> and removing odbc32.lib and
odbccp32.lib from the <CODE>Linker / Input / Additional Dependencies</CODE> field.
These libraries are not needed for this assignment.
<LI> Many of the methods in the <CODE>Image</CODE> class specify that they return an integer.
If the method has successfully done what it should do, a value of 1 is returned. Otherwise a
value of 0 is returned. In the skeleton code, the methods have not been implemented, so a
0 value is returned. As you implement the methods, you should make them return a value of 1.
<LI>In order to implement the <CODE>Image::RandomDither</CODE> method, you will need to add
random noise to each color channel of each pixel and then clamp to the appropriate quanitzation
level. The amount of noise that you should add depends on the number of bits your are using
for quantization and should be just enough to push a color from its <CODE>Floor</CODE> to its
<CODE>Ceiling</CODE>. Specifically, given a number of bits for quantization, each quantization level
corresponds to a range of values where the size of the range is <CODE>R=256/2**bits</CODE> so the
noise that you add should be a random number in the range [<CODE>-R/2</CODE>,<CODE>R/2</CODE>].
For example, if you have only 4 bits to represent the colors in the range
[0,255], each quanitzation level corresponds to a range of 16 values, and the noise that you add
should be a random number in the range [-8,8].
<LI> In the <CODE>Image::Blur</CODE> method, convolving with a low-pass Gaussian filter means using a
filter (mask) whose entries are defined by a Gaussian with large variance. (The values should fall
off slowly as entries move away from the center.) If you are having trouble with this, look over the notes from
the first lecture on image processing to see how the width/variance of the Gaussian is related to the size of
the mask.)

<H3>Overview</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In this assignment you will create a simple image processing 
  program, a pared-down version of Adobe Photoshop or The Gimp. The operations 
  that you implement will be mostly filters which take in an input image, 
  process the image, and produce an output image.

<H3>Getting Started</H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
You should use the code skeleton as a starting point for your assignment. We provide you with several files, but you should
only have to change <CODE>image.todo.cpp</CODE> and <CODE>lineSegments.todo.cpp</CODE>. 
<UL>
  <LI><CODE>main.cpp</CODE>: Parses the command line arguments, and calls the appropriate image functions.
  <LI><CODE>Util/cmdLineParser.[cpp/h]</CODE>: Code for processing the command line arguments.
  <LI><CODE>JPEG/*.[cpp/h]</CODE>: Functions for the back end of jpeg file reading and writing. You won't need to
  modify these, but you will have to compile them into a library to support reading and writing
  files in this format.
  <LI><CODE>Image/bmp.[cpp/h]</CODE>: Functions to read and write Windows 24-bit BMP files.
  <LI><CODE>Image/jpeg.[cpp/h]</CODE>: Functions to read and write jpeg images.

  <LI><CODE>Makefile</CODE>: The makefile for compiling the <CODE>assignment1</CODE> executable under Unix (use 'gmake' to build!!). </LI>

</UL>
  <!--
  <P>You can find test images at <A href="http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~cs557/assn1/images/">here</A> . 
  -->
  <P>After you copy the provided files to your directory, the first thing to do is compile the program.
  To do this, you will first have to compile the <CODE>JPEG</CODE> library and then compile the
  <CODE>assignment1</CODE> executable. 
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
  <B>On a Windows Machine</B><br>
  Begin by opening <CODE>Assignment1.sln</CODE> using Microsoft Visual Studio.
  <UL>

    <LI> Build <CODE>Assignment1.exe</CODE> by selecting <CODE>Build -> Build Solution</CODE> or <CODE>Ctrl + Shift + B</CODE>. (If it has not been compiled yet, this will also compile the <CODE>JPEG</CODE> library.)
  </UL>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
  <B>On a Unix Machine</B><BR>

  <UL>
    <LI> Type <CODE>make</CODE> to compile the <CODE>Assignment1</CODE> executable. (If it has not been compiled
    yet, this will also compile the <CODE>JPEG</CODE> library.)

<H3>How the Program Works</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The user interface for this assignment was kept to the simplest possible, so you can concentrate on the image
processing issues. The program runs on the command line. It reads an image from a specified file, processes the
image using the filter specified by the command line arguments, and writes the resulting image to the specified
file.<BR>
The command line parser is set up to read the arguments from the command line that are specified in the following
format: First the parameter name is specified by pre-pending with <B>two</B> hyphens, and then the parameter values
are enumerated. (Note that the number of arguments associated to each parameter are fixed in <CODE>main.cpp</CODE>
and the order in which the parameters are specified is ignored.)<BR>
For example, to increase the brightness of the image <CODE>in.bmp</CODE> by 10%, and save the result in the image

<CODE>out.bmp</CODE>, you would type:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>% Assignment1 --brighten 1.1 --in in.bmp --out out.bmp</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
To see the full list of possible arguments, you can simply type:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>% Assignment1</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
This gives you a list of all the possible parameter names and the number and meaning of the associated parameter
values. Bracketed parameters are optional (an input image file and an output image file need to be specified).<BR>
Note that since the order in which parameters are specified is ignored, if you want to apply two filters to a single
image you can specify parameters for both filters, but you cannot control the order in which the filters are applied.
For some filters, the order in which the filters are applied does not affect the output image while for others, the
output image may depend on the order. (For the latter case, you can control the ordering by applying one filter,
writing the output to a temporary image, and then applying the second filter to the temporary image.)<BR>
The current <CODE>main.cpp</CODE> decides if the specified image file is Windows BMP file or a JPEG file based on the
file extension.

    Compose two images by overlaying the target image over the source.<BR>

    <B>Note</B>: In practice, Windows BMP files and JPEG files only specify 3-channel, RGB (no alpha), images. Thus,
    in order to generate an image with an alpha-channel, composition is performed by calling something akin to:
    <BLOCKQUOTE>%assignment1 --in source.bmp --composite overlay.bmp matte.bmp --out out.bmp</BLOCKQUOTE>
    Then, in <CODE>main.cpp</CODE>, the method <CODE>Image32::SetAlpha</CODE></U>
    is called to set the alpha-channel of the image <CODE>overlay.bmp</CODE> using
    the image <CODE>matte.bmp</CODE>. This generates a 4-channel, RGBA, image that is passed along to
    <CODE>Image::Composite</CODE> for compositing.

    <LI>(1) Create a composite image of yourself and a famous person. 


    <LI>(2)
    <A HREF="Documentation/class_image32.html#a30">Image32::FunFilter</A> (<CODE>image.todo.cpp</CODE>):<BR>

    Warp an image using a non-linear mapping of your choice (examples are fisheye, sine, bulge, swirl). 

    <LI>(6) <B>Beier-Neely Morphing</B>:<BR>
    Morph two images using the method in Beier Neely's 
    <A href="../Readings/beier92.pdf">Feature-based Image Metamorphosis</A>.<BR>
    <A HREF="BNMorph.html">See this page</A> for more information about the command line, input options, and some
    test cases. <BR>
    To make your life easier, the <CODE>Image32::BeierNeelyMorph</CODE> function already has a body which interpolates
    the line segments, calls the warping function <CODE>Image32::Warp</CODE> and then cross-dissolves the resultant
    images by calling <CODE>Image32::CrossDissolve</CODE>.<BR>

    The <CODE>Image::Warp</CODE> function calls <CODE>OrientedLineSegmentPairs::getSourcePosition</CODE> which determines
    the position of the source pixel given the position of the target.<BR>
    In order to get this function to actually return the desired image, you will need to implement the following methods:

    <UL>

        <LI><A HREF="Documentation/class_oriented_line_segment.html#a3">OrientedLineSegment::length</A> (<CODE>lineSegments.todo.cpp</CODE>):<BR>

	This method returns the length of the line segment.

        <LI><A HREF="Documentation/class_oriented_line_segment.html#a4">OrientedLineSegment::distance</A> (<CODE>lineSegments.todo.cpp</CODE>):<BR>
	This method returns the shortest distance from the point <CODE>(x,y)</CODE> to the line segment.

        <LI><A HREF="Documentation/class_oriented_line_segment.html#a5">OrientedLineSegment::getPerpendicular</A> (<CODE>lineSegments.todo.cpp</CODE>):<BR>

	This method writes the coordinates of the unit-vector perpendicular to the direction of the line segment.<BR>
	Note: When implementing this method, be sure to choose the orientation of the perpendicular vector consistently.

        <LI><A HREF="Documentation/class_oriented_line_segment.html#e1">OrientedLineSegment::GetSourcePosition</A> (<CODE>lineSegments.todo.cpp</CODE>):<BR>
	This method uses a single pair of source and target line segments to define the position of the source pixel, given the position
	of the target pixel. (To change the way in which the blending occurs, you will want to change the default values of the parameters
	<CODE>OrientedLineSegment::A</CODE>, <CODE>OrientedLineSegment::B</CODE>, and <CODE>OrientedLineSegment::P</CODE>.)

        <LI><A HREF="Documentation/class_image32.html#a31">Image32::Warp</A> (<CODE>image.todo.cpp</CODE>):<BR>

	This method uses a set of oriented line segment pairs to warp the current image. In order to implement this method
	you will most likely want to call <CODE>OrientedLineSegmentPairs::getSourcePosition</CODE> which returns the
	position of the source pixel you want to sample at in order to compute the color value at the target. (Assuming
	that you have implemented <CODE>OrientedLineSegment::GetSourcePosition</CODE>, the
	<CODE>OrientedLineSegmentPairs::getSourcePosition</CODE> method should not need any implementation.)

        <LI><A HREF="Documentation/class_image32.html#e1">Image32::CrossDissolve</A> (<CODE>image.todo.cpp</CODE>):<BR>
	This static method takes in two images and a cross-disolving value in the range [0,1], and generates the specified blend
	of the two images.

    </UL>

</UL>
The assignment will be graded out of <B>30 points</B>. In addition to implementing these features, there are several other ways to get more points:
<UL>
    <LI>(1) Submitting one or more images for the art contests.
    <LI>(1) Submitting a <CODE>.mpeg</CODE> or <CODE>.gif</CODE> movie animating 
    the results of one or more filters with continuously varying parameters.
    You can generate such a video by outputting the results of your filter in JPEG format and
    then using an executable such as <a href="https://www.ffmpeg.org/">FFmpeg</a> or <A HREF="http://www.ndrw.co.uk/">JPGAvi</A> which stitches
    together a collection of JPEG files into a single movie. Alternatively, if you are a Linux user,
    you can use the <CODE>mpeg_encode</CODE> command or The Gimp to produce an animated gif for your results.
    <LI>(2) winning the regular art contest, 

</UL> For images or movies that you submit, you also have to submit
the sequence of commands used to created them, otherwise they will not
be considered valid.  <P> It is possible to get more than 30
points. However, after 30 points, each point is divided by 2, and
after 32 points, each point is divided by 4. If your raw score is 29,
your final score will be 29. If the raw score is 33, you'll get
31.25. For a raw score of 36, you'll get 32.</P> </BLOCKQUOTE> <HR>
