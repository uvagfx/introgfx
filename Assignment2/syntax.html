<P>For this project we define a rudimentary scene graph language. Each command 
begins with a #-sign and goes on until the next command or until the end of the 
file is reached. Commands may extend across new-line characters. All color 
values are floating point values between 0.0 and 1.0, and all other numeric 
expressions are assumed to be floating point, also, unless otherwise 
noted.&nbsp; Angles are given in radians. When needed, the parser automatically 
scales a vector to a unit-length vector. You should not that in order to define 
triangles&nbsp; you must first define the vertices you will use and then index 
them in the triangle definition. 
<P><FONT size=+2>Commands:</FONT> 
<P><B>#camera</B> <BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; px py pz</B> 
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dx dy dz</B> <BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ux uy uz</B> 
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ha</B> 
<P>This defines a perspective camera in the scene. <I>(px,py,pz)</I> is the 
position of the camera in world coordinates, <I>(dx,dy,dz)</I> is a vector 
describing the direction of the camera, and <I>(ux,uy,uz)</I> is a vector in the 
up direction.&nbsp; The <!--half-height--> height angle of the viewing frustum is given by 
<I>ha</I>, such that the <!--half-width--> width angle can be found by <I>ha*ar, </I>where 
<I>ar</I> is the width-over-height aspect ratio of the output image (given on 
the command line). The <I>camera</I> command must appear before of any 
<I>Group</I> or <I>Shape</I> directives.&nbsp; The first <I>camera</I> found in 
the file will be used, and subsequent <I>camera</I> definitions are ignored. 
<P><B>#background</B> <BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; r g b</B> 
<P>The background color defines the color to assign to rays which fail to 
intersect any object, and leave the scene.&nbsp; Only the first 
<I>background</I> definition encountered is used, and subsequent instances are 
ignored.&nbsp; It must appear before any <I>Group</I> or <I>Shape</I> 
directives.&nbsp; If not defined, a value of black is assumed. 
<P><B>#ambient</B> <BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; r g b</B> 
<P>Sets the global ambient light level. The first <I>ambient</I> definition is 
used, and subsequent instances are ignored.&nbsp; It must appear before any 
<I>Group</I> or <I>Shape</I> directives. If not defined, a value of black is 
assumed. 
<P><B>#light_num n</B> 
<P>The total number of lights in the scene is given by this command.&nbsp; This 
command must appear before any <I>light_*</I> definitions.&nbsp; It must appear 
before any <I>Group</I> or <I>Shape</I> directives. If there are no lights in 
the scene (only global ambient light), <I>light_num 0</I> need not be declared. 
<P><B>#light_point</B> <BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; r g b</B> 
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; px py pz</B> <BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ca la qa</B> 
<P>This defines a point light in the scene.&nbsp; <I>(r,g,b)</I> gives the color 
of the light.&nbsp; In this ray tracer, use this single light color for diffuse 
and specular contributions at each surface.&nbsp; Do not compute ambient 
contributions from each light, but rather use the global ambient light defined 
by the <I>ambient</I> directive.&nbsp; Each instance must appear before any 
<I>Group</I> or <I>Shape</I> directives. 
<P><I>(px,py,pz) </I>gives the position of the light in world coordinates.&nbsp; 
The attenuation of the light with distance from its position is given by <I>ca, 
la, </I>and <I>qa </I>which define the constant, linear and quadratic components 
of the attenuation factor.&nbsp; If <I>d</I> is the distance from the light to 
the surface, then the light's color at the surface is given by (<I>r,g,b</I>) 
*<I>1.0/</I> (<I>ca </I>+ <I>la*d</I> + <I>qa*d*d</I>).&nbsp; Each coeficient 
must be positive or equal to zero. Note: to achieve no attenuation use a 
<I>(ca,la,qa)</I> of (<I>1.0,0.0,0.0</I>). 
<P><B>#light_spot</B> <BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; r g b</B> 
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; px py pz</B> <BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dx dy dz</B> 
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ca la qa</B> <BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sc sd</B> 
<P>This defines a spot point light in the scene.&nbsp; <I>(r,g,b)</I> gives the 
color of the light.&nbsp; In this ray tracer, use this single light color for 
diffuse and specular contributions at each surface.&nbsp; Do not compute ambient 
contributions from each light, but rather use the global ambient light defined 
by the <I>ambient</I> directive. Each instance must appear before any 
<I>Group</I> or <I>Shape</I> directives. 
<P><I>(px,py,pz) </I>gives the position of the light in world coordinates, and 
<I>(dx,dy,dz)</I> is a unit vector describing the direction of the 
light.&nbsp;&nbsp; The attenuation of the light with distance from its position 
is given by <I>ca, la, </I>and <I>qa </I>which define the constant, linear and 
quadratic components of the attenuation factor.&nbsp; If <I>d</I> is the 
distance from the light to the surface, then the light's color at the surface is 
given by (<I>r,g,b</I>) *<I>1.0/</I> (<I>ca </I>+ <I>la*d</I> + 
<I>qa*d*d</I>).&nbsp; Each coeficient must be positive or equal to zero. Note: 
to achieve no attenuation use a <I>(ca,la,qa)</I> of (<I>1.0,0.0,0.0</I>). 
<P>The spot light cutoff is given by <I>cs</I> and defines the half angle of 
divergence of the light cone.&nbsp; It can be measured as the angle from the 
center axis to the edge of the spot cone.&nbsp; It should be less than 
<I>pi/2</I> radians.&nbsp; The fall off in intensity from the center axis to the 
cone edge is given by the spot drop-off factor, <I>sd</I>.&nbsp; It can take 
values from <I>0.0</I> to <I>128.0</I>, where <I>0.0</I> indicated constant 
intensity across the cone, and <I>128.0</I> yields a sharp fall-off.&nbsp; The 
cosine of the angle between light direction and the direction of a ray from 
<I>(px,py,pz)</I> to the point being lit, raised to the power of <I>sd</I> 
will yield the correct result. 
<P><B>#light_dir</B> <BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; r g b</B> 
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dx dy dz</B> 
<P>This defines a directional light in the scene.&nbsp; <I>(r,g,b)</I> gives the 
color of the light.&nbsp; In this ray tracer, use this single light color for 
diffuse and specular contributions at each surface.&nbsp; Do not compute ambient 
contributions from each light, but rather use the global ambient light defined 
by the <I>ambient</I> directive. Each instance must appear before any 
<I>Group</I> or <I>Shape</I> directives. 
<P><I>(dx,dy,dz) </I>is a vector giving the direction of the light in the scene. 
Note that attenuation makes no sense for directional lights, and so is not a 
parameter of this directive. 
<P><B>#texture_num n</B> 
<P>The total number of textures used in the scene is given by this 
command.&nbsp; The command must appear before any <I>texture</I> AND/OR 
<I>material</I> definitions.&nbsp; It must appear before any <I>Group</I> or 
<I>Shape</I> directives. If there are no textures used, <I>texture_num 0</I> 
need not be declared. 
<P><B>#texture filename</B> 
<P>Each texture used in the scene is declared by the <I>texture</I> directive 
using the filename of the texture.&nbsp; The first texture declared will take 
the interger identifier <I>0</I>, and subsequent textures will follow in order 
(i.e. <I>1, 2, 3</I>, ...). This integer handle is used in <I>material 
</I>definitions to indicate that the material includes the respective texture. 
Textures need to be declared before materials. This declaration must appear 
before any <I>Group</I> or <I>Shape</I> directives. 
<P><B>#vertex_num n</B> <BR>The total number of vertices to be used in the 
scene. The command must appear before any <I>vertex</I> definitions.&nbsp; This 
declaration must appear before any <I>Group</I> or <I>Shape</I> directives. 
<P><B>#vertex</B> <BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; px py pz</B> 
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nx ny nz</B> <BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ts tt</B> 
<BR>This defines a verex at position (<I>px,py,pz</I>) with normal 
<I>(nx,ny,nz</I>) and texture coordinate (<I>ts,tt</I>). Each vertex used in the 
scene is declared by the <I>vertex</I> directive. The first vertex declared will 
take the interger identifier <I>0</I>, and subsequent vertices will follow in 
order (i.e. <I>1, 2, 3</I>, ...). This integer handle is used in <I>triangle 
</I>definitions to indicate which vertices make up the triangle. This 
declaration must appear before any <I>Group</I> or <I>Shape</I> directives. 
<P><B>#material_num n</B> 
<P>The total number of materials used in the scene is given by this 
command.&nbsp; The command must appear before any <I>material</I> 
definitions.&nbsp; This declaration must appear before any <I>Group</I> or 
<I>Shape</I> directives. 
<P><B>#material</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; er eg eb</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ar ag ab</B> 
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dr dg db</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sr sg sb sfo</B> 
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tr tg tb</B> 
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ir</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tn</B>
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; !string!</B> 
<P>Each material used in the scene is declared by the <I>material</I> 
directive.&nbsp; The first material declared will take the interger identifier 
<I>0</I>, and subsequent materials will follow in order (i.e. <I>1, 2, 3</I>, 
...). This integer handle is used in <I>shape </I>definitions to indicate that 
the rendering should occur with the appropriate material.&nbsp; This declaration 
must appear before any <I>Group</I> or <I>Shape</I> directives. 
<P>The colors (<I>er,eg,eb</I>), (<I>ar,ag,ab</I>), (<I>dr,dg,db</I>), and (<I>sr,sg,sb</I>)
are the emmisive, ambient, diffuse, and specular colors of the 
material, respectively. The emmisive material color acts 
independently of any light source, the ambient material color is used in ambient 
light calculation with the global ambient light color, and the diffuse and specular 
material colors are used in diffuse and specular lighting computations with the 
color of each light in the scene. 
<P>The exponent <i>sfo</i> defines the specular 'shininess' (or 'fall-off') of the material,
and takes  values from <I>0.0</I> to <I>128.0</I>. The cosine of the angle between the 
ray direction and the specular reflection direction raised to the power of <i>sfo</i> 
gives the specular highlight factor. <i>sr</i>, <i>sg</i>, and <i>sb</i> define the reflection 
coefficient for recursive reflection rays. The index of refraction is given by 
<I>ir</I> and is used in Snell's Law computations for refraction 
direction.&nbsp; For non-closed surfaces, such as triangles, it is assumed that 
<I>ir</I> is the index of refraction on the backside of the surface.&nbsp; For 
closed surfaces, such as cones, it is assumed that <I>ir</I> is the index of 
refraction on the inside of the surface. 
<P>To assign a texture to this material, <I>tn</I> should be the integer handle 
of the appropriate texture declared in the file.&nbsp; At rendering time, it is 
assumed that the color of the appropriate texture pixel will modulate the color 
computed by the lighting equation.&nbsp; If no texture is to be associated with 
the material, then a value of <I>-1</I> must be&nbsp; indicated. 
<P>The final parameter is a string delimited by exclaimation marks.&nbsp; The 
string must not contain any control characters, or unpredicatable behaviour 
could occur.&nbsp; This field is provided for the users to assign material 
properties not defined by this file format.&nbsp; For instance, the numeric 
constants describing a Perlin Noise 3D solid texture could be put in this field 
to instruct the rendered to how to texture shapes which are drawn with this 
material.&nbsp; If no unsupported parameters are required, empty exclamation 
marks must conclude the material declaration as follows: !! 
<P><B>#ray_file_num&nbsp; n</B> 
<P>The total number of .ray files used in the scene is given by this command. 
The command must appear before any <I>ray_file</I> definition. This declration 
must appear before any <I>Group</I> or <I>Shape</I> directives. 
<P><B>#ray_file&nbsp; fileName</B> 
<P>Each ray_file used in the scene is declared by the <I>ray_file</I> directive. 
The first ray_file declared will take the identifier <I>0</I>, and subsequent 
ray_files will follow in order (i.e. <I>1,2,3</I>, ...). This integer handle is 
used in scene-graph definitions to indicate that the scene-graph specified by 
the file should occur as a node to the current scene-graph. This declaration 
must appear before any <I>Group</I> or <I>Shape</I> directives. 
<P><B>#group_begin</B> <BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; m11 m21 m31 m41</B> 
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; m12 m22 m32 m42</B> <BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; m13 m23 
m33 m43</B> <BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; m14 m24 m34 m44</B> <BR><B>#group_end</B> 
<P>This pair of directives defines a node that will be added to the current 
scene-graph with the specified transformation context. All objects within the 
<I>group_begin</I> .. and associated <I>group_end</I> directive are subject to 
the 4x4 transformation matrix given in the <I>group_begin</I> declaration.&nbsp; 
Groups may be nested, permitting the specification of a transformation 
heirarchy.&nbsp; Shapes within nested groups are subject, in order, to the 
transformation contexts of all their enclosing groups.&nbsp; The total 
transformation context of a given shape is determined, then, by starting with 
the matrix of the root enclosing group, and concatenating additional matrices on 
the right as we decend into nested groups, until we reach the shape.&nbsp; The 
transformation context of a group is applicable only to its shapes and sub 
groups, so we must remove matrices from the right as we ascend back up the 
heirarchy. 
<P>The matrix elements appear as follows and are intended to operate on column 
vectors: 
<P><TT>|m11 m21 m31 m41|</TT> <BR><TT>|m12 m22 m32 m42|</TT> <BR><TT>|m13 m23 
m33 m43|</TT> <BR><TT>|m14 m24 m34 m44|</TT> 
<P>Note: When the .ray file is initially parsed the root scene-graph node is 
instantiated with the identity matrix, so that <I>Shape</I>s specified outside 
any <I>Group</I> directives are still valid. 
<P><B>#shape_* m ...</B> 
<P>All shapes that can be defined are prefixed by <I>shape_</I> and take a 
common first parameter <I>m</I> which indicates the integer handle of the 
material to use when rendering the object.&nbsp; Subsequent descriptions of the 
supported shapes will omit explanations of the <I>m</I> parameter... <BR>&nbsp; 
<P><B>#shape_sphere&nbsp; m</B> <BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cx cy cz</B> 
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; r</B> 
<P>This defines a sphere, situated at the point (<I>cx,cy,cz</I>) with a radius 
given by <I>r</I>. 
<P><B>#shape_box&nbsp; m</B> <BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cx cy cz</B> 
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lx ly lz</B> 
<P>This defines an axis aligned box, centered at the point 
(<I>cx,cy,c</I>z).&nbsp;&nbsp; The length of the <I>x</I>,<I> y</I>, and 
<I>z</I> axis aligned sides is given by <I>lx, ly, </I>and<I> lz,</I> 
respectively. The box extends from <I>x=cx-lx/2</I> to <I>x=cx+lx/2</I>, 
<I>y=cy-ly/2</I> to <I>y=cy+ly/2</I>, and <I>z=cz-lz/2</I> to <I>z=cz+lz/2</I>. 
<P><B>#shape_cylinder m</B> <BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cx cy cz</B> 
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; r h</B> 
<P>This defines a cylinder, with a central axis parallel to the y-axis, and 
centered at the point (<I>cx,cy,cz</I>).&nbsp; The radius and height are given 
by <I>r</I> and <I>h</I>, respectively.&nbsp; The cylinder is a closed surface 
(i.e. it has end caps.)&nbsp; The ends lie at y=cy-h/2 and y=cy+h/2. 
<P><B>#shape_cone&nbsp; m</B> <BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cx cy cz</B> 
<BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; r h</B> 
<P>This defines a cone, with a central axis parallel to the y-axis, and centered 
at the point (<I>cx,cy,cz</I>).&nbsp; The radius and height are given by 
<I>r</I> and <I>h</I>, respectively.&nbsp; The cone is a closed surface (i.e. 
it's base is capped) The base and apex of the cone lie at <I>y=cy-h/2</I> and 
<I>y=cy+h/2</I>, respectively. 
<P><B>#shape_triangle&nbsp; m</B> <BR><B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i1 i2 i3</B> 
<BR>This defines a triangle with vertices indexed by <I>i1</I>, <I>i2</I>, and 
<I>i3</I>. 
<P><B>#ray_file_instance&nbsp; n</B> 
<P>This specifies the index of the scene-graph, that is to be added as a node to 
the current scene-graph. </P></BODY></HTML>
