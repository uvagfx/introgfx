<h3>Ray Tracer Results</h3>
</center>
<hr>
<p>This page is designed to give you a sense of what your images should look like. In particular, it will show you
the results that you should be getting as your progress through the implementations of the different features of the
ray tracer. For all of these images, it is assumed that you have called:
</p><blockquote>
% Assignment2 --in test.ray --out test.bmp --width 500 --height 500 --rLimit 5 --cLimit 0.0001
</blockquote>
to generate the image output to <code>test.bmp</code>. (Make sure that you have downloaded not only
<a href="RayFiles/test.ray"><code>test.ray</code></a> but also
<a href="RayFiles/square.ray"><code>square.ray</code></a>
and <a href="RayFiles/sphere.ray"><code>sphere.ray</code></a> as the file <code>test.ray</code> references these two.)

If you have written your <b>RaySphere</b>::<b>intersect</b> properly, the generated image should look like:
<p><img src="progress_files/test1.jpg" width="250">
</p></li><li>
If you have written your <b>RayTriangle</b>::<b>intersect</b> properly, the generated image should look like:
<p><img src="progress_files/test2.jpg" width="250">
</p></li><li>
If you have modified your <b>GetColor</b> so that it returns the emissive and ambient components of the lighting
equation, the generated image should look like:
<p><img src="progress_files/test3.jpg" width="250">
</p></li><li>
If you have written your <b>RayLight</b>::<b>getDiffuse</b> properly, the generated image should look like:
<p><img src="progress_files/test4.jpg" width="250">
</p></li><li>
If you have written your <b>RayLight</b>::<b>getSpecular</b> properly, the generated image should look like:
<p><img src="progress_files/test5.jpg" width="250">
</p></li><li>
If you have written your <b>RayLight</b>::<b>isInShadow</b> properly, the generated image should look like:
<p><img src="progress_files/test6.jpg" width="250">
</p></li><li>
If you have modified your <b>RayGroup</b>::<b>intersect</b> so that it takes into account the associated transformation
of the scene-graph node, the generated image should look like:
<p><img src="progress_files/test7.jpg" width="250">
</p></li><li>
If you have modified your <b>GetColor</b> to recursively cast rays in the reflected direction, the
generated image should look like:
<p><img src="progress_files/test8.jpg" width="250">
</p></li><li>
If you have modified your <b>GetColor</b> to recursively cast rays in the transparent direction, the
generated image should look like:
<p><img src="progress_files/test9.jpg" width="250">
</p></li><li>
If you have implemented your <b>RayLight</b>::<b>transparency</b> to use partial shadows, the generated image should
look like:
<p><img src="progress_files/test10.jpg" width="250">
</p></li></ul>

Once you have implemented your accerelated ray-tracer, you may want to try running it on some of the more complex
models. <b>It is not recommended that you try running your ray-tracer on these models if you have not implemented
acceleration. The models consist of thousands of triangles and will take just shy of forever to ray-tracer without
acceleration.</b>

The resulting image you would get from running your ray-tracer on the <a href="RayFiles/dog.ray"><code>dog.ray</code></a> should look
like:
<p><img src="progress_files/dog.jpg" width="250">
</p></li><li>
The resulting image you would get from running your ray-tracer on the <a href="RayFiles/bunny.ray"><code>bunny.ray</code></a> should look
like:
<p><img src="progress_files/bunny.jpg" width="250">
</p></li><li>
The resulting image you would get from running your ray-tracer on the <a href="RayFiles/buddha.ray"><code>buddha.ray</code></a> should look
like:
