</ul>

<h2>Course Description</h2>

This course covers the fundamentals of 2D and 3D computer graphics.
This includes image processing, the modern scanline-based renering pipeline (e.g. OpenGL), ray
tracing, and animation.  We will not study (and you are not required
to have any experience with) graphics packages such as Maya or 3D
Studio Max.  You will instead come to understand the principles upon
which those types of systems are based.  All the software you use will
be your own creation in C/C++ and you should expect to do a lot of
programming.

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<ul>
  <li> CS2150 Program and Data Representation (required)
  <li> Programming in C/C++ (required)
  <li> MATH3351 Elementary Linear Algebra (suggested, not required)
</ul>

<h2>Suggested Textbooks (copies of each are on reserve at Brown)</h2>
